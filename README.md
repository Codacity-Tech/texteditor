# texteditor

I am trying to build a advance rich-text editor purely with Python! This has not been fully developed as of yet and will be undergoing constant constructions within the next few days.

To be able to run the app, you just need to run main.py

This is for deepening my learning s of Python(Please don't mind if this isn't the best ever app :)
